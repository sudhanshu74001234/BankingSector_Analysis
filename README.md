📊 Banking Analytics Dashboard — README
📌 Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive banking data analysis combining descriptive analytics and correlation-based insights. It aims to help financial institutions better understand customer behavior, account relationships, and key performance metrics through an interactive dashboard.

The solution integrates exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical correlation studies, and data visualization to identify trends and relationships across different banking products.

🔍 Key Features & Indicators
The dashboard provides real-time insights into:

Total Clients – Number of unique customers in the dataset.

Total Loan – Aggregate loan amounts across all customers.

Total Deposit – Total deposits made across all account types.

Total Fees – Sum of all service and transaction fees collected.

Total Credit Card Amount – Outstanding credit card balances.

Saving Account Amount – Balances in savings accounts.

📈 Insights & Findings
Strongest Positive Correlations observed between Bank Deposits, Checking Accounts, Saving Accounts, and Foreign Currency Accounts, indicating that customers with high balances in one account type often hold significant funds in others.

Cross-product balance patterns suggest opportunities for targeted marketing and product bundling.

Loan and Deposit Trends can help in forecasting liquidity requirements and customer engagement strategies.
